    <h1>What We Do</h1>

    <h2>Website Design and Development</h2>

    <div class="service">
      <img src="/assets/eydev-web-design.jpg" alt="eydev office" />
      <p>Every website we create is built mobile first, by hand, with site performance in mind. This means your site will load fast, which will increase SEO, and therefore increase pageviews and revenue. We do not create sites using CMS, page builders, or templates. Those options are bloated, slow, and â€“ quite frankly, old news. We build sites line by line, pixel by pixel. Your site will be optimized for speed, look beautiful on any device, and will be future-proof.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Lifetime Updates and Free Hosting</h2>

    <div class="service">
      <p>You don't need to worry about hosting your own website, we have you covered. We host your site securley, in a private repository, and provide a free SSL certificate so your website is also secure to browse. We also offer <strong>free lifetime updates</strong>. From a full redesign to a minor content change, we will update your site at no additional charge. And, for smaller content adjustment or styling changes, we will typically get that updated on the same day you request it.</p>

    <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>

    <div class="service">
      <img src="/assets/eydev-seo-website.jpg" alt="eydev office" />
